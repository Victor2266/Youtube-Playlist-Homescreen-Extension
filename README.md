Do you never seem to get around to watching the videos in your watch later playlist?
With this addon, the playlist will be front and center in the middle of the YouTube homepage so you might be enticed to finally work through it.

- Enhance your YouTube homepage by adding any playlist you choose. Enjoy seamless integration, customizable rows, and shortcuts to open the playlist directly or to 'See All Playlists'.
- Warning: YouTube has removed access to the watch later playlist from the API so you will have to transfer your watch later videos to a different playlist to have them show up with this extension. There are other extensions which allow you to quickly do this for example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHFR3S22qMo
